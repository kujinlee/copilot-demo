### Key Takeaways and the Systematic Approach We Followed:

#### Key Takeaways:
- **Consistency:** Ensuring the axios instance used in the service is the same one being mocked in the tests.
- **Detailed Logging:** Adding detailed logging to trace the flow of execution and identify issues.
- **Incremental Testing:** Starting with a minimal reproducible example and gradually adding complexity.
- **Mocking Correctly:** Ensuring the mock setup correctly intercepts the requests made by the axios instance.
- **Persistence and Attention to Detail:** Debugging requires persistence and attention to detail.

#### Systematic Approach:
1. **Identify the Issue:** Understand the error message and identify where the issue might be occurring.
2. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** Simplify the code to isolate the issue and ensure basic functionality works.
3. **Ensure Consistency:** Ensure that the configuration (e.g., base URL) is consistent between the service and the test.
4. **Add Detailed Logging:** Add logging to trace the flow of execution and identify where things might be going wrong.
5. **Mock the Correct Instance:** Ensure that the mock setup is applied to the correct axios instance used in the service.
6. **Gradually Add Complexity:** Once the minimal example works, gradually add back the complexity to ensure each part works correctly.

### Consistency in Configuration:
- **Ensure that the axios instance used in the service is the same one being mocked in the tests.**
- **Export the axios instance from the service file to use it directly in the test file.**

### Detailed Logging:
- Adding detailed logging helps trace the flow of execution and identify where things might be going wrong.

### Incremental Testing:

### Morale:
- **Persistence:** Debugging can be challenging, but persistence and systematic problem-solving are key to resolving issues.
- **Attention to Detail:** Small differences in configuration or setup can lead to issues, so attention to detail is crucial.
- **Learning from Errors:** Each trial and error is a learning opportunity that helps improve problem-solving skills.

### The Difference Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Code:
The difference between synchronous and asynchronous code can indeed matter, especially when dealing with promises and asynchronous operations like HTTP requests. Here are some key points to consider:

#### Key Differences:

##### Promise Handling:
- **Asynchronous Functions (async/await):** These functions return a promise and allow you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner. They make it easier to handle asynchronous operations and errors.
- **Synchronous Functions:** These functions do not return a promise and execute sequentially. They are not suitable for handling asynchronous operations like HTTP requests.

##### Error Handling:
- **Asynchronous Functions:** Using try/catch blocks with async/await allows for more straightforward error handling.
- **Synchronous Functions:** Error handling can be more complex when dealing with promises directly.

### Why It Mattered in This Case:

#### Consistency:
- The minimal version of the service used async/await, which ensured that the functions returned promises. This consistency helped the mock setup correctly intercept the requests.
- The original version initially did not use async/await, which might have caused issues with promise handling and mocking.

#### Mocking and Interception:
- The mock setup using axios-mock-adapter works by intercepting HTTP requests made by the axios instance. Ensuring that the functions return promises (async/await) helps maintain the correct flow of asynchronous operations, making it easier for the mock setup to intercept and respond to requests.

### Conclusion:
- **Using async/await:** Ensuring that the service functions are asynchronous and return promises helps maintain consistency and makes it easier to handle asynchronous operations and errors.
- **Mocking:** Properly mocking the axios instance and ensuring that the functions return promises helps the mock setup correctly intercept and respond to requests.

### Final Thoughts:
The systematic approach we followed, including creating a minimal reproducible example, ensuring consistency, and adding detailed logging, helped identify and resolve the issue. The use of async/await played a crucial role in maintaining the correct flow of asynchronous operations and ensuring that the mock setup worked as expected.

Ensuring that the axios instance used in the service is the same one being mocked in the tests is crucial for several reasons:

### Key Reasons:

#### Consistency:
- **Single Source of Truth:** By using the same axios instance in both the service and the tests, you ensure that all configurations (e.g., base URL, headers) are consistent. This avoids discrepancies that can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- **Mocking Accuracy:** Mocking the exact instance used in the service ensures that the mock setup correctly intercepts the requests made by the service methods.

#### Isolation:
- **Test Isolation:** Using a dedicated axios instance for the service and mocking that instance in the tests helps isolate the tests from external dependencies. This ensures that the tests are not affected by actual network requests or external services.
- **Controlled Environment:** Mocking the axios instance allows you to control the responses and simulate different scenarios (e.g., success, failure) without relying on external factors.

#### Error Handling:
- **Consistent Error Handling:** By using the same axios instance, you ensure that error handling is consistent across the service and the tests. This helps in accurately testing how the service handles different error scenarios.

### Why Export the Axios Instance?

#### Reusability:
- **Shared Configuration:** Exporting the axios instance allows you to reuse the same configuration across different parts of the application and in the tests. This ensures that any changes to the configuration are applied consistently.
- **Ease of Mocking:** Exporting the axios instance makes it easy to import and mock it in the test files. This simplifies the test setup and ensures that the mock setup is applied to the correct instance.

#### Maintainability:
- **Centralized Configuration:** Having a centralized axios instance makes it easier to manage and update the configuration. Any changes to the configuration need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
- **Simplified Tests:** By exporting the axios instance, the test files can focus on mocking and testing the service methods without worrying about configuring axios separately.
