# Todo List Application - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Todo List application built with React.js. It allows users to manage their todo items by creating, updating, and deleting them.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todo-list-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Folder Structure

- `public/`: Contains the static files, including `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the React components and application logic.
  - `components/`: Contains individual React components.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application.
  - `App.css`: Styles for the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Add new todo items.
- Mark todo items as completed.
- Delete todo items.

The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform these operations.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) - Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app.
